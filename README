VERIHUBSCOINS

Verihubscoins is an application that allows users to track all existing coins, add it to the tracked list, and also delete it from the tracked list.
Upon registration, the user first will be asked to enter information such as email, password, and password confirmation. Then, registered users can log in and access the main
endpoints of the application by using JWT token.

How to run the application:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following commands:
    - create a .env file in the root directory and add the "SECRET_KEY" variable
    - python -m venv venv to create a virtual environment for the project
    - source venv/Scripts/activate => (windows) to activate the virtual environment    
    - pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the dependencies
    - uvicorn main:app --reload to run the application
3. Open the browser and go to http://localhost:8000/docs to access the Swagger documentation
*note that the Swagger documentation does not provide the Bearer token, therefore it is recommended to use Postman to test the endpoints with the Auth Type of Bearer Token.

I also attached the Postman collection in the repository, you can import it to Postman and test the endpoints.
